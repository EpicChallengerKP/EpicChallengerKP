I'm a curious and passionate creator building Awesome games, tools, and experiences that push the limits of creativity and emotional depth in Unreal Engine 5.

- **NovaRoads Plugin** – My custom R&D UE5 plugin for **procedural road generation** with Blueprint spline support, landscape deformation, bridges, intersections, and more. (R&D Personal Project)
- **Dating Sim** – A realistic 3D narrative experience that explores themes of isolation, connection, and contrast through rich character interactions. (Currently in the very early stages of Devlopment)

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Game Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.6
- **Programming**: C++, UE Blueprints, Python
- **Tools**: Unreal Engine, Blender, Maya, Zbrush, Substance Painter, Git, Figma
- **Extras**: Working with Procedural Mesh Component, Landscape Patch Actors, Post-processing, and AI assistant training

## ✨ Interests & Side Quests
