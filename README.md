# Hi, I'm Kamalpreet Singh Nafray

UE5 Game Designer / Developer | AI Enthusiast | Storyteller

I’m a curious and passionate creator building games, tools, and interactive experiences in Unreal Engine 5, with a focus on emotional depth, experimentation, and meaningful player experiences.



## What I’m Working On

- **Psychological Horror Game (University Project)**  
  Creative Director on a UE5 team project exploring sanity systems, distorted choices, and psychological storytelling.

- **NovaRoads (UE5 Plugin)**  
  A personal R&D plugin for procedural road generation with Blueprint splines and non-destructive landscape deformation.

- **3D Dating Sim (Personal Project)**  
  An early-stage narrative-driven game about isolation, connection, and contrast through realistic character interactions.



## Tech I Use

- Unreal Engine 5  
- UE Blueprints, Python and sometimes C++
- Blender, ZBrush, Substance Painter
- Procedural systems, landscape tools, and post-processing
